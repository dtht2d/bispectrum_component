The aim of {PyXtal} {FF} is to promote the application of atomistic simulations by providing several choices of structural descriptors and machine learning regressions in one platform. Based on the given choice of structural descriptors (including the atom-centered symmetry functions, embedded atom density, {SO}4 bispectrum, and smooth {SO}3 power spectrum), {PyXtal} {FF} can train the {MLPs} with either the generalized linear regression or neural networks model, by simultaneously minimizing the errors of energy/forces/stress tensors in comparison with the data from the ab-initio simulation. The trained {MLP} model from {PyXtal} {FF} is interfaced with the Atomic Simulation Environment ({ASE}) package, which allows different types of light-weight simulations such as geometry optimization, molecular dynamics simulation, and physical properties prediction. Finally, we will illustrate the performance of {PyXtal} {FF} by applying it to investigate several material systems, including the bulk {SiO}2, high entropy alloy {NbMoTaW}, and elemental Pt for general purposes.

	abstract = {The properties of electrons in matter are of fundamental importance. They give rise to virtually all molecular and material properties and determine the physics at play in objects ranging from semiconductor devices to the interior of giant gas planets. Modeling and simulation of such diverse applications rely primarily on density functional theory ({DFT}), which has become the principal method for predicting the electronic structure of matter. While {DFT} calculations have proven to be very useful to the point of being recognized with a Nobel prize in 1998, their computational scaling limits them to small systems. We have developed a machine learning framework for predicting the electronic structure on any length scale. It shows up to three orders of magnitude speedup on systems where {DFT} is tractable and, more importantly, enables predictions on scales where {DFT} calculations are infeasible. Our work demonstrates how machine learning circumvents a long-standing computational bottleneck and advances science to frontiers intractable with any current solutions. This unprecedented modeling capability opens up an inexhaustible range of applications in astrophysics, novel materials discovery, and energy solutions for a sustainable future.},

	abstract = {A natural extension of the descriptors used in the Spectral Neighbor Analysis Potential ({SNAP}) method is derived to treat atomic interactions in chemically complex systems. Atomic environment descriptors within {SNAP} are obtained from a basis function expansion of the weighted density of neighboring atoms. This new formulation instead partitions the neighbor density into partial densities for each chemical element, thus leading to explicit multi-element descriptors. For \$N\_\{elem\}\$ chemical elements, the number of descriptors increases as \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{O\}(N\_\{elem\}{\textasciicircum}3)\$, while the computational cost of the force calculation as implemented in {LAMMPS} is limited to \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{O\}(N\_\{elem\}{\textasciicircum}2)\$ and the favorable linear scaling in the number of atoms is retained. We demonstrate these chemically aware descriptors by producing an interatomic potential for indium phosphide capable of capturing high-energy defects that result from radiation damage cascades. This new explicit multi-element {SNAP} method reproduces the relaxed defect formation energies with substantially greater accuracy than weighted-density {SNAP}, while retaining accurate representation of the bulk indium phosphide properties.},

The crucial properties that such representations (sometimes called descriptors) must have are differentiability with respect to moving the atoms, and invariance to the basic symmetries of physics: rotation, reflection, translation, and permutation of atoms of the same species. We demonstrate that certain widely used descriptors that initially look quite different are specific cases of a general approach, in which a finite set of basis functions with increasing angular wave numbers are used to expand the atomic neighbourhood density function. Using the example system of small clusters, we quantitatively show that this expansion needs to be carried to higher and higher wave numbers as the number of neighbours increases in order to obtain a faithful representation, and that variants of the descriptors converge at very different rates. We also propose an altogether new approach, called Smooth Overlap of Atomic Positions ({SOAP}), that sidesteps these difficulties by directly defining the similarity between any two neighbourhood environments, and show that it is still closely connected to the invariant descriptors. We test the performance of the various representations by fitting models to the potential energy surface of small silicon clusters and the bulk crystal.},

Their versatility is due, in addition to other factors, to properties that can be easily modulated according to the intended application. It is therefore important to study and map the electronic structure of these materials to allow for a better correlation between structure and properties. Electrochemical scanning tunnelling spectroscopy ({EC}-{STS}) can be a powerful tool to characterize the electronic structure of the semiconductor electrolyte interface. In this work we have used image-based {EC}-{STS} ({IB}-{EC}-{STS}) to describe quantitatively the band structure of an electrochemically deposited polypyrrole ({PPy}) film. {IB}-{EC}-{STS} located the band edge of the polymer’s valence band ({VB}) at 0.95 V vs. {RHE} (-5.33 {eV} in the absolute potential scale) and the intragap polaron states formed when the polymer is oxidised (doped) at 0.46 V vs. {RHE} (-4.84 {eV} in the absolute potential scale). The {IB}-{EC}-{STS} data were cross checked with electrochemical impedance spectroscopy ({EIS}) and Mott-Schottky analysis of the interfacial capacitance.

            A fundamental challenge in materials science is to understand the atomic-level structures of nanoarchitectures assembled from synthetic polymers. Here, we report a family of sequence-defined polypeptoids that form free-floating crystalline 2-dimensional nanosheets, in which not only individual polymer chains and their relative orientations, but also atoms in nanosheets were directly observed by cryogenic transmission electron microscopy. These atomic details are inaccessible by conventional scattering techniques. Using the feedback between sequence-controlled synthesis and atomic imaging, we observed how the nanosheet structure responds to chemical modifications at the atomic-length scale. These atomic-level insights open the door to the design of bioinspired nanomaterials with more precisely controlled structures and properties.

              Rational design of supramolecular nanomaterials fundamentally depends upon an atomic-level understanding of their structure and how it responds to chemical modifications. Here we studied a series of crystalline diblock copolypeptoids by a combination of sequence-controlled synthesis, cryogenic transmission electron microscopy, and molecular dynamics simulation. This family of amphiphilic polypeptoids formed free-floating 2-dimensional monolayer nanosheets, in which individual polymer chains and their relative orientations could be directly observed. Furthermore, bromine atom side-chain substituents in nanosheets were directly visualized by cryogenic transmission electron microscopy, revealing atomic details in position space inaccessible by conventional scattering techniques. While the polypeptoid backbone conformation was conserved across the set of molecules, the nanosheets exhibited different lattice packing geometries dependent on the aromatic side chain
              para
              substitutions. Peptoids are inherently achiral, yet we showed that sequences containing an asymmetric aromatic substitution pattern pack with alternating rows adopting opposite backbone chiralities. These atomic-level insights into peptoid nanosheet crystal structure provide guidance for the future design of bioinspired nanomaterials with more precisely controlled structures and properties.},

	abstract = {Starting from the Euler equation expressed in a rotating frame in spherical coordinates, coupled with the equation of mass conservation and the appropriate boundary conditions, a thin-layer (i.e. shallow water) asymptotic approximation is developed. The analysis is driven by a single, overarching assumption based on the smallness of one parameter: the ratio of the average depth of the oceans to the radius of the Earth. Consistent with this, the magnitude of the vertical velocity component through the layer is necessarily much smaller than the horizontal components along the layer. A choice of the size of this speed ratio is made, which corresponds, roughly, to the observational data for gyres; thus the problem is characterized by, and reduced to an analysis based on, a single small parameter. The nonlinear leading-order problem retains all the rotational contributions of the moving frame, describing motion in a thin spherical shell. There are many solutions of this system, corresponding to different vorticities, all described by a novel vorticity equation: this couples the vorticity generated by the spin of the Earth with the underlying vorticity due to the movement of the oceans. Some explicit solutions are obtained, which exhibit gyre-like flows of any size; indeed, the technique developed here allows for many different choices of the flow field and of any suitable free-surface profile. We comment briefly on the next order problem, which provides the structure through the layer. Some observations about the new vorticity equation are given, and a brief indication of how these results can be extended is offered.},

	abstract = {We present sum rules for Clebsch-Gordan coefficients in the framework of {SO}(4) group-theoretical description of the hydrogen atom. The main results are obtained using properties of the Runge-Lenz- Pauli vector, in particular expressing the matrix elements of the powers of its last component both in spherical and parabolic basis. Connections with Stark effect and diamagnetism of the hydrogen atom are outlined.},
